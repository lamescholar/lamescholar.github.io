My guide to research on a specific topic.
<br><br>

First, look at the review articles. You can find a bibliography in them. Review articles can be found in encyclopedias. See [Reference books](/en/reference-books).

Wikipedia articles have a bibliography.

DuckDuckGo gives out good materials, in which you can also find literature on the topic.

Finally, look at this universal bibliography:

Then go to look for sources:

[Books](/en/libraries)

[Newspaper articles](/en/newspapers)

[Journal articles](/en/articles)
