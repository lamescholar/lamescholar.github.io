My guide to research any topic.
<br><br>

First, look at the review articles. You can find bibliographies in them. Review articles can be found in encyclopedias. See [Dcitionaries](/en/dictionaries).

Wikipedia articles have a bibliography.

DuckDuckGo gives out good materials, where you can also find literature on the topic.

Finally, look at this universal bibliography:

Then you can go look for sources:

[Particular book](/en/book-searching)

[Books](/en/libraries)

[Newspaper articles](/en/newspapers)

[Journal articles](/en/articles)

[Magazine issues](/en/magazines)

[Films](/ru/films)

[Music](/ru/music)
