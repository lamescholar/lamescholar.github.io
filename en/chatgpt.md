ChatGPT is a great tool for translation and self-education.
<br><br>

On Translation.

ChatGPT input limit is 2000 characters. Therefore if you're translating a long text, you need to paste it in chunks.

ChatGPT forgets previous messages very fast. Therefore if you write to ChatGPT:

```
Translate incoming messages from German to English.
```

ChatGPT will translate 3 messages. And then the setting will go off. Therefore you need to constantly demand what you need, make requests like:

```
Translate from German to English.

text
```

So as not to bother yourself typing "Translate from German to English." each time, write to ChatGPT:

```
Interpret the symbol * as the phrase "Translate from German to English."
```

ChatGPT remembers this substitution for a long time. Now you can ask for translation this way:

```
*

text
```

If ChatGPT doesn't translate the text, start New chat.
<br><br>

You can ask ChatGPT to explain a word:

```
Explain word влиять.
```
<br>

You can ask ChatGPT for a bibliography:

```
Can you provide a bibliography on vikings?
```
