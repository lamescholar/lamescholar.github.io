ChatGPT is a great tool for translation and self-education.
<br><br>

ChatGPT input limit is 2000 characters. Therefore if you're translating a long text, you need to send it in chunks:

```

chunk of the text
```

If ChatGPT has stopped translating, start New chat.

You can ask ChatGPT to explain a word:

```
Explain word влиять.
```
<br>

You can ask ChatGPT for a bibliography:

```
