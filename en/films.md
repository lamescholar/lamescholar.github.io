To play MKV, MP4 or AVI file install [K-Lite Codec Pack Standart](https://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm) and open file with Media Player Classic.

Hotkeys for Media Player Classic:

Ctrl+L - to load subtitles. W - to turn off subtitles. F1, F2 - to move subtitles. Cltr+O - to load audio.

#### To rip DVD or Blu-Ray:

Get the disc. Buy it or rent it from local library.

**Option 1. MKV**

1) Extract contents of the disk into MKV container with [MakeMKV](https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6237783).

2) Compress MKV with [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php). I use H.264 MKV presets. Before starting thoroughly check Audio and Subtitles. If there is 5.1 track it should stay 5.1 in the output. If HandBrake uses 100% of CPU, Video->Advanced Options: ``threads=2``

**Option 2. ISO**

1) Create ISO image of DVD with [DVD Decrypter](http://www.dvddecrypter.org.uk/).

2) Then you can play ISO file with [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html). This way it's as though you own a disk.
