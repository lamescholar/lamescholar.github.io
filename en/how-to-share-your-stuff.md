title: How to share your stuff
---

To share a group of files (series, book series, music album), you can publish it as a torrent release on [1337x](https://1337x.to/register). It is public torrent site, but to upload you need to apply for uploader status.

There are private torrent trackers that you can get on via interview. [Redacted](https://interviewfor.red/en/starting.html) is a musical private tracker. [My Anonamouse](https://www.myanonamouse.net/inviteapp.php) is mainly about ebooks and audiobooks. Releases on private trackers available only for its members.

To share a digitized book, you can upload it to:

Library Genesis - <https://libgen.li/librarian.php>

Z-Library - <https://singlelogin.re/book-add>

To share your entire library use P2P networks:
