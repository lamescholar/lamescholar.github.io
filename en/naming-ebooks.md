title: Naming ebooks
---

On the Internet, ebooks can often be found with a random title, which is inconvenient to store. Therefore, such books should be renamed.

You cannot use a question mark, quotation marks, or a colon in the file name. Use underscores instead.

For example:

Block, Ned et al. (eds.) - The Nature of Consciousness_ Philosophical Debates - 1997

et al. (et alii - and others) is used to abridge the list of authors.

(eds.) is used to indicate the editors of the compilation.

If you want to list to authors, abridge the first name to one letter:

Osterhammel J., Camiller P. - The Transformation of the World_ A Global History of the Nineteenth Century - 2014
