title: Naming ebooks
---

On the Internet, ebooks can often be found with a random title, which is inconvenient to store. Therefore, such books should be renamed. You can use RuTracker standard:

Nagel T. - What Does It All Mean__ A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy - 1987

You can not use a question mark, quotation marks, or a colon in the file name. Underscores are used instead.

If you want to preserve a name of author, use comma:

Block, Ned et al. (eds.) - The Nature of Consciousness. Philosophical Debates - 1997

et al. (et alii - and others) is used to abridge the list of authors.
