Thanks to the emergence of the Internet, the free exchange of information has become possible. Yet this free flow of information remains undeground, little known to the public. The reason for that is intellectual property, standing in the way of true freedom of information. Modern Internet artificially stricts distribution of cultural heritage of humanity for sake of outdated system of commodity production.
