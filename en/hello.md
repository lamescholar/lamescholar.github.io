It all started with realisation that most of the ebooks I find online are not made by wage labor, but by enthusiasts sharing their library out of sheer joy of sharing. I tracked down the workflow along the forums. I found programs and steps to make ebooks on your own.

To find and share stuff, first things first, install a BitTorrent client (see [P2P](/en/p2p)). It will allow you to download releases from torrent sites.

From my guides you can learn how<br>
to [create](/en/how-to-digitize-books), [share](/en/how-to-share-your-stuff), [find](/en/how-to-find-books) and [read](/en/ebook-formats) ebooks,<br>
to rip [DVDs](/en/films) and [CDs](/en/music#ripping-cds),<br>

Internet makes possible the free exchange of information - piracy. It remains underground, little known to the public because modern states ensure that information is conducted strictly through the channels of commodity production and rent. By endowing <s>people</s> companies with intellectual property rights, modern states limit the distribution of cultural heritage via the Internet.
