What it's all about? One day I just realised that most of the ebooks on my laptop were scanned illegally. They were not made by high sanction with expensive corporate equipment. They were not made for a wage. They were made by enthusiasts with basic equipment and software. Anyone can make ebooks for its own sake.

Internet makes possible the free exchange of information - P2P networks. They remain little known. Modern states ensure that information is conducted strictly through centralised channels that operate via ads, collection of private data and rent. By endowing <s>people</s> companies with intellectual property rights, modern states limit the distribution of cultural heritage via the Internet.
