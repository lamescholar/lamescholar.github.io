There are 4 main ebook formats:

[DjVu](/en/djvu)

[PDF](/en/pdf)

[FB2, EPUB](/en/fb2-epub)
<br><br>

DjVu file is a scan.

PDF file is a scan or a layout.

FB2 file is XML file (text file with formating) with description and images in Base64 format.

EPUB files are zipped HTML files with description, styles, images and fonts.
<br><br>

So, DjVu and PDF are formats for scans. FB2 and EPUB are text formats.

These formats emerge from [book digitization](/en/book-digitization). If you process and encode scans, you get DjVu or PDF. If you recongize the text on the scans, you get FB2.
