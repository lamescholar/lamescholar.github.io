title: How to name ebooks
---

I often find ebooks with random title. If I store as they are, it would be impossible to find anything later. I rename them.

Use this format:

Block, Ned et al. (eds.) - The Nature of Consciousness_ Philosophical Debates - 1997

et al. (et alii - and others) is used to abridge the list of authors.<br>
(eds.) is used to indicate the editors of the compilation.

Windows doesn't allow to use a question mark, quotation marks, or a colon in the file name. Use underscores instead.

If you want to list two authors, abridge the first name to one letter:

Osterhammel J., Camiller P. - The Transformation of the World_ A Global History of the Nineteenth Century - 2014
