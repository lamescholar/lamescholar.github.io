title: How to find books

Usually, when I'm looking for the ebook, I check 5 sources:

Library Genesis - <https://libgen.is/>

Z-Library - <http://loginzlib2vrak5zzpcocc3ouizykn6k5qecgj2tzlnab5wcbqhembyd.onion/>

VK - <https://vk.com/docs>

RuTracker - <http://rutracker.org/forum/index.php>

Flibusta - <http://flibusta.is/a>
<br><br>

If the book is in English and it is not in these 5 sources, check Internet Archive. They have a lot of digitized books because they cooperate with American libraries:

<https://archive.org/>
<br><br>

The book can only be available for rental for an hour. This script helps here:

<br><br>

If the book is not in all of these sources, last chance is [googling](/en/search-engines) it. If there is no book in Google, then most likely the book was never digitized. You can digitize it yourself. See [How to create ebooks](/en/how-to-create-ebooks).
