title: Book searching

Whenever I'm looking for an ebook, I check 6 sources:

Library Genesis - <https://libgen.is/>

Z-Library - <https://singlelogin.re/>

VK - <https://vk.com/docs>

RuTracker - <http://rutracker.org/forum/index.php>

Twirpx - <https://www.twirpx.org/>

Flibusta - <http://flibusta.is/a>
<br><br>

If the book is in English and it is not in these 5 sources, you can look at the Internet Archive. There are a lot of digitized books there due to the cooperation with American libraries:

<https://archive.org/>
<br><br>

The book can only be available for rental for an hour. The script helps here.

Look [Internet Archive](/en/internet-archive).

If the book is not in all of these sources, last chance is [googling](/en/search-engines) it. If there is no book in Google, then most likely the book is not digitized. You can digitize it yourself. Look [Book digitization](/en/book-digitization).
