In this release you can find database of KoLXo3 library.
<br><br>

You need to get two files out of it:

kolkhoznik.db.rar

kolkhozkik_0.7.0_win64.rar
<br><br>

Put .db file in the folder.
<br><br>

File->Configure->Database Path->*/kolkhoznik/kolkhoznik.db
<br><br>

With this database, you can search for books on a topic of interest.

You find the right book, copy the hash sum (MD5), search for a file in Library Genesis libgen.is by hash sum.
<br><br>

You can install the KoLXo3 library on your hard disk too.

In this case you can do a full-text search and use the library locally.
