title: ebook name
---

On the Internet, ebooks can often be found with a random title, which is inconvenient to store. Therefore, such books should be renamed. Personally, I use the rutracker standard for this:

Nagel T. - What Does It All Mean__ A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy - 1987

You cannot use a question mark, quotation marks, or a colon in the file name. You can use underscores instead.
