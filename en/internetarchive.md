**Internet Archive**<br/><br/>

With that Python script you can download any book from Internet Archive. In case of copyrighted books, to download pages of the book script uses 1 hour loan. To convert images to PDF script is using img2pdf package. But it creates too big PDF file. So I recommend you to keep -j setting at the end of the command to get only the images. Three options how you can efficiently convert them into PDF or DjVu follow.<br/><br/>

Git - <https://git-scm.com/download/win>

Pictures are downloaded without a certain DPI. Because of this, there may be problems when creating a file. DPI can be set using the IrfanView program.

In addition to DPI fix, if the scans are dark and the text is faded, you can use Contrast and Gamma correction color correction tools in the Irfan View program. I use the following grid of values (the first column is Contrast, the second is Gamma correction):

90 4.00

70 3.00

50 2.00

30 1.50

These are the values for the case when the scan is dark and it needs to be brightened. If the standard options are not suitable, you need to experiment with different combinations - Shift+G. Visually Contrast makes the text bold, brightens the background. Gamma correction lightens of the scan, but bleach the text. Useful combinations: 70 2.00 (the scan is not very dark, there is greenish or orange tint), only Contrast - 50/70 (the scan is not very dark, the text is faded), 50 0.75 (the scan is quite light, the text is faded), only Gamma correction - 0.62 (the scan is very light).

If there is greenish or orange tint remaining, you can lower the color saturation of the scan. Saturation tool is used for this. The value is -100/-150.

In addition to color correction tools, Sharpen tool is very often useful. It is used in the presence of blurred text (photography defect). The optimal value is 30.<br/><br/>
