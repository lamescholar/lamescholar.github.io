There are two methods to digitize a book.
<br><br>

#### Method №1. Photographing

**You need:**

Phone

Stand

<sub>Save the picture and find similar stands on sale using [Google Images](https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en)</sub>

Lamp

Weight (for example, a puck) for pressing pages

External battery

**Disadvantages of photographing:**

Variation of text size due to page flipping

Imperfect straightening of lines by the Book Restorer program

**Advantages:**

Availability

**Description:**

Fix the phone on the stand. Turn on the lamp. Put the book so that one page completely falls into the frame of camera. Pull this page with one hand. If the second page starts to slam, put a weight on it (for example, a puck). Press the button with your other hand. The resulting photos are processed by special programs.

To do a b/w ebook or a b/w ebook with colored illustrations (method of separated scans), look [DjVu](/en/djvu).

To do a colored ebook, look [PDF](/en/pdf).

To do a text ebook, look [FB2, EPUB](/en/fb2-epub).
<br><br>

#### Method №2. Scanning

You need only a scanner.

Second-hand scanners are cheap.

Scans are processed by special programs.

#### Practical recommendations on digitization

+ Before digitization check if the book is already on the Internet. Look [Book searching](/en/book-searching).

+ How to get a book for digitization? Get it in the library. Sign up for the largest local library: there you can find books and periodicals that you won't find anywhere else. If the largest local library allows reading only inside the library, ask if there is a paid service of photographing, and if there is, photo a book inside the library. If you didn't find neccesary book in the libraries, then buy it.

+ During digitization, you can listen to lecture, podcast or audiobook.

+ After photographing, check if you have missed a page or photographed one page twice. An effective method is to quickly scroll 10 photos and see if the page number has grown by 10 or not. If it grew by 10, there was no mistake.
