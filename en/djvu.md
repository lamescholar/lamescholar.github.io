<a id="scan-tailor"></a>
**Scan Tailor Universal** - program for images processing.

Settings:<br>
General->Ask every time. Untick.<br>
General->Thumbnails panel->Scale cashed images to this size: 1000 px<br>
General->Tiff compression->TIFF compression (b/w): CCIITTFAX4<br>
Page layout->Margins. 10 everywhere.<br>
Page layout->Alignment->Auto-Magnet alignment. Tick.<br>
Output->Hold spacebar to display original page. Tick.<br>
Output->Mixed mode->Foregroud layer. Untick.

New Project... Select a folder with pictures. Then you can remove some pictures from the project, for example, the cover.

To enlarge miniatures, press Alt and scroll.

For comfortable navigation between minatures use keys pgup and pgdn.

**Processing:**

1) Fix Orientation

Rotatation of pages on 90 degrees. To apply to a group of pictures, click Apply to... Select the scope.

2) Split Pages

If there is a piece of another page in the pictures or two pages in the pictures, start. The program will either crop the picture or split it into two. Just in case, it is better to check behind the program and view the result on thumbnails.

3) Deskew

Text skew correction.

4) Select Content

The program automatically finds the content of the page - throws a rectangle on the page, the content of which will be taken into the final image. Again, launch and then check for the program and, in case of inaccuracy, correct it manually.

5) Page Layout

If the content rectangle is small, the margins can be 5 mm. If you process images with the cover, you need to make zero margins for the cover and uncheck Match size with other pages.

6) Output

Look at the result of binarization. If parts of the letters disappear - set the Binarization threshold to 20. In extreme cases - 30. An increased Binarization threshold adds boldness to the text. If the book got pictures, you must use the Mixed mode. Untick Auto layer. Tick Picture zone layer. Untick Equalize illumination, if pictures lose details. Let's run the output. The program will automatically find pictures. After the output you need to check behind the program. Look through all the pages with pictures. In the same time you are looking for spots on pages that can be deleted in Fill Zones section. If the picture zone was found incorrectly, you need to correct it. You need to go to the Layers section. Either drag vertices. Or delete the zone and create your own. You right-click on the picture, hold down Ctrl to make the area rectangular and draw a rectangle. If the zone has a complex shape, you make a polygon. The picture zone can be used on a part of the picture where the text is poorly recognized (text details will disappear during binarization). Split text and images. Tools->Export...->Export. After processing the images, save the project.
