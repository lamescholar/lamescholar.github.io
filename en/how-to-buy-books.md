#### Clear book covers

If you're buying paperbacks, spend extra 15 dollars and buy a pack of clear book covers. Clear book cover protects a paperback from wearing out, adds rigidness to cover and gives it a nice gloss. For Penguin paperbacks pick 7 3/4" (the actual height is 8"):

For books with dust jackets use Brodart covers:

For full library style, fix the dust jacket with filament strapping tape:
