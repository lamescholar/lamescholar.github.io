**Introduction**

When referring to copyright, the conversation often turns to topics such as the defense of creation, the protection of "creative genius," and the uniqueness of a work. This rhetorical baggage has ultimately reinforced the idea that there is a nearly ontological link between an author and their work: as if copyright were a kind of natural prosthetic for artistic personality. A more careful look, however, reveals that copyright is essentially an economic mechanism, a device historically created to resolve (or attempt to resolve) issues of remuneration and control over the dissemination of works.

The cultural industry functions on very delicate balances: on one side, authors, publishers, and distributors often call for protective measures (typically favoring an increasingly broad interpretation of copyright). On the other side, piracy practices emerge, exposing the unsustainability of a regulatory framework built on the principle of "close everything, block everything, extend protection terms as long as possible." The key aspect is that many of these practices do not arise to deprive authors of their wealth, but rather as a reaction – often a true civil disobedience (Longo 2023) – to an increasingly monopolistic system, where media giants condition the rules of the game.

The history of *Nosferatu* (1922) by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau is a textbook example. Today, it is part of cinema history, but at the time, the film almost disappeared, victim of a legal case that required the destruction of all films, because they violated the copyright of Dracula by Bram Stoker (1897). It was the illicit circulation that saved it: pirate copies that passed from theater to theater and from country to country, escaping the celluloid fires decreed by the court. If the verdict had been respected, today Nosferatu would be one of those lost films for which we are left with just two lines in the manuals (Eisner 2012). If it is part of our history, it is thanks to piracy.

Even Dracula's editorial history highlights an ambiguous relationship between the need to pay authors and a system that, in fact, has become a more terrifying vampire than the Count himself. Indeed, due to some bureaucratic negligence, Bram Stoker was unable to adequately protect the novel in the United States, thereby losing control of the rights in American territory. Yet it was precisely that legal loophole that facilitated the widespread diffusion of Dracula and ensured its global success. A ironic but illuminating contradiction: the absence of restrictions fostered the myth, while the intervention of copyright – as in the case of *Nosferatu* – threatened to destroy it (Skal 1990).

Considering the folkloric origin (and thus collective) of the vampire myth and the strange editorial history of these works, an essential point emerges: creativity is not a gift that descends from a solitary hermit, but the result of a weave of inspirations and collective reinterpretations that, if blocked by proprietary obsession, cannot unfold. It is no coincidence that Shakespeare – one of the most celebrated authors ever – has extensively plundered chronicles, fairy tales and previous texts, and that his genius lies also in his ability to remix the content, give it new form and new life. If he were alive today, probably a descendant of Holinshed would have already sued him for a million dollars (and perhaps we would have lost a piece of literary heritage) (Bullough 1975).

Copyright then becomes a thermometer of a structural problem: when copyright becomes excessively rigid, creative communities (and consuming ones) react by circumventing it or openly challenging it. The history of Napster and its countless imitators, of Karagarga and his film reel sharing, of Sci-Hub and its "freed" academic article packages, confirms that people do not give up exchanging contents, especially if they perceive access to them as a fundamental right, or if they sense the injustice of a system where the usual monopolies profit, while those who actually create the work often end up with empty pockets. In the following paragraphs, we will explore:

<sub>1 – Like copyright – from its origins to Anna's Statute of 1710 up to today's extensions (such as the "Mickey Mouse Protection Act") – has been shaped more than anything to protect commercial interests and power agreements, rather than to defend creative genius.</sub>

<sub>2 - To what extent is each work of authorship, in fact, a collective work based on shared cultural foundations and indebted to a continuous exchange of ideas and techniques. The concept of copyright thus emerges as an economic, not an ontological, device, and must be treated as such.</sub>

<sub>3 – How does the current approach to copyright demonstrate its inadequacy in the face of generative artificial intelligence.</sub>

<sub>4 - Why piracy, far from being merely an illegal or "immoral" phenomenon, often represents a form of civil disobedience that demands access to knowledge and refutes the assumption that control over works always benefits those who created them.</sub>

*Nosferatu*, Dracula, Shakespeare – the entire history of art and literature tells us, in essence, that the excessively high barriers erected by copyright do not truly protect culture. On the contrary, it is thanks to the cracks in these barriers, and to those who navigate them as pirates, that many masterpieces have continued to live. For this reason, perhaps it is time to critically reassess our understanding of copyright, revealing its true essence – an economic mechanism – and placing at the center what really matters: the collective creativity of humankind and the fair remuneration of those who contribute to it.
<br><br>

**From the first real licenses to Statute of Anne**

Halfway through the fifteenth century, the invention of movable type printing by Gutenberg (1440) triggered a revolution in the circulation of knowledge (Eisenstein 1979); books began to spread with an unprecedented speed, partly escaping the control that the Church – and not only the Church – had over handwritten copies. In this new scenario, Venice played a pioneering role. The city of the lagoon was among the first to formalize mechanisms similar to printing privileges (Heller 2013; Bastianello 2016): it often granted an exclusive right to a printer for a determined period of time, sometimes in exchange for payment. Copyright was not yet discussed, but rather a temporary monopoly in favor of those who owned expensive printing equipment and assumed the financial risks of the business. It is telling that the "rebels" of that time were already referred to as "pirates" – according to some sources, the use of the term dates back as far as 1680, directed at those who evaded the official records of book dealers and printers (Johns 2009, Longo 2023).

Thus, the history of the content industry largely coincides with that of the strategies devised by publishers, guilds, and monarchies to control access to texts, and simultaneously with that of secret circuits that bypassed such barriers (Johns 2009). The more rigid the legal tools became, the more forms of marginal or openly illegal distribution multiplied, a phenomenon that echoes what happened centuries later with digital sharing (file-sharing) via the internet.

The true legal turning point came at the beginning of the Eighteenth Century in England with the Statue of Anne (1710). Considered the first act to give form to the modern copyright, it recognized exclusive publication and selling rights for bookellers and printers (not directly to the authors) for a defined period (Feather 2006). Behind this lay the intent to limit the immense power of the Stationers' Company – a powerful corporation that, up to that point, had held a sort of monopoly over printing, and at the same time functioned as a censorship apparatus (Rose 1993).

Despite some celebrating it as the first measure to protect authors, the Statute of Anna had a more pragmatic objective: to prevent editorial privileges from becoming permanent monopolies (Deazley 2008). It thus opened a temporary window of time within which an author could (often for trivial sums) assign their exclusive rights to a publisher, which would then manage production and distribution. In other words, it was an act of economic balancing in the printing market: guaranteeing an exclusive period, but not eternal, and regulating what, in fact, was an emerging industry.

Meanwhile, in France, the Revolution (1791–1793) had produced laws that, at least on paper, transferred the "property" of works from monarchical authority to the authors (Briggs, Burke 2005). However, in that context, a market for licenses soon emerged, where the main beneficiaries were the new publishing agents. The same Condorcet (1776/1788) – more hostile to Diderot's idea of authorship – warned against the risk of a proprietary drift in ideas, at the expense of collective interest. In essence, the norms of that period sought to limit the absolute monarchy's control over the press, but ultimately supported a form of protection closer to commercial logic and the new entrepreneurial elites.

**The author becomes immortal. From the Enlightenment ideal to contemporary lobbies**

After the French Revolution, the prospect of freeing the ownership of works from monarchical power and recognizing it to the authors was accepted – at least on a theoretical level – as an emancipating gesture (Darnton 1982). The main axis of this system was further consolidated with the internationalization of copyright initiated by the Berne Convention (1886), which extended the protection of works on a sovereign level and pushed the states that joined towards a homogeneous regulation (Ricketson, Ginsburg 2006).

Throughout the 20th century, the duration of protection gradually extended, officially to ensure an adequate economic return to authors (Landes, Posner 2003). However, the problem lies in what we could define as a temporal inconsistency: if at the beginning copyright lasted only a few years to avoid monopolies, with the rise of large cultural, cinematic, and music industries, those limitations were repeatedly revised and expanded (Boldrin, Levine 2008). The slogan is: "We protect creativity, otherwise authors will have no incentive to produce quality works!" In reality, in most cases, the rights belong to the publishing giants or the majors, while authors, especially emerging ones, end up receiving minimal compensation (Towse 2001).

In this sense, the "Emblematica" is the case of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 (also known as the "Mickey Mouse Protection Act"), which was voted in the United States right at the expiration of the rights to the first short films of Mickey Mouse (Lessig 2001). Without this extension, characters like Mickey Mouse would have entered the public domain, making them freely usable and reinterpreted. Disney then strongly lobbied to extend the copyright term, extending it beyond 70 years after the author's death. This passage reveals the schizophrenia of a system that, on one hand, celebrates freedom and the circulation of ideas, while on the other hand excessively restricts the use of works that are now widely in the past.

Meanwhile, in Europe and elsewhere, posthumous rights have followed the same trend, standing at 70 years after death (or even 90 in particular legal systems). It is natural to ask: if the objective of copyright is genuinely to promote culture, why continue to extend the duration far beyond what is necessary for a reasonable remuneration? It is plausible that behind the rhetoric of protecting the artist, there are actually market interests capable of influencing legislative policies (Litman 2006).

The phenomenon has become even more evident in the digital age, with the introduction of DRM (Digital Rights Management), watermarks, regional blocks, and automatic filters, up to the criminalization of the simple act of sharing protected content without license (Yu 2011). A striking example was Napster (1999), a P2P platform that had anticipated the growing demand for digital music at low or no cost (Gillespie 2007). The music industry reacted by considering it an existential threat, leading to forced closures and million-dollar lawsuits. Paradoxically, Napster had highlighted users' desire to access a vast catalog in a practical and immediate way, a need that other services (iTunes, Spotify) have since tried to satisfy through subscriptions, yielding only marginal revenues for authors (Towse 2001).

Since then, the wars of streaming – with the proliferation of services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ – have reignited the debate: is piracy really a sin of the users, or rather a natural reaction to a market that pulverizes content across a thousand paid platforms, rebuilding the wall of fragmentation and increasing overall costs? (Longo 2023). In his research on pirate communities, Alessandro Y. Longo shows how it often involves enthusiasts who wish to preserve or recover unavailable works, just as happened with *Nosferatu* (1922).

We have thus arrived at a model in which the extension of protection and the tightening of laws reveal a systemic nature: copyright, conceived as an incentive, risks transforming into a near-perpetual control mechanism (Boyle 2008). If originally the short terms of protection were meant to avoid monopolies in the book industry, now extensions multiply, extending the sphere of protection far beyond the lifespan of the authors. For many, piracy has become the most or less explicit response to this imbalance of power.

**Collective nature of creation**

When thinking about creative work, our imagination often returns to the romantic idea of genius, a figure almost beyond human, creating wonderful works from nothing. It is an idea of authorship mainly coming from European Romanticism, but it seems to have adapted very well to the individualistic context of contemporary Western society (Didino 2024). This vision of intellectual and artistic creation, however, is extremely limited. Indeed, every artist, musician, or writer draws upon a repertoire of knowledge, tools, and inspirations inherited from the cultural, social, and technological context in which they live (Kuhn 1962, Ferguson 2010); the product of genius does not arise from the will of a creative monad, but from networks of causes of which the author is a necessary but not sufficient part.

An emblematic example, as we mentioned, is Shakespeare, whose greatness also lies in his ability to 'steal' and remix diverse sources: from chronicles and folk tales, to Italian novellas (one might think, for example, of Belleforest's Histoires tragiques for Hamlet), down to influences from the Elizabethan dramatic tradition. As Rose (1993) notes, the myth of the solitary bard is a retrospective construction: Shakespeare worked in a context of continuous exchanges and mutual appropriations between various playwrights. Similarly, Mozart and many other composers did not hesitate to reuse existing themes or recycle their harmonies (De Simone 2002), fueling a debate that still today blurs the line between inspiration and plagiarism.

It was in the 18th century that the author began to be conceived as the individual creator of a unique and irreplicable work, an idea that justified copyright as a natural right emerging from creative labor (Bennet 2005). However, this idealized view obscures the fact that many works, even classical ones, are the result of adaptations, reinterpretations, and dialogues with previous traditions (Rose 1993). In treating works as exclusive property of a single author, copyright tends to ignore these collaborative dynamics and conflicts with the historical reality of a creativity fueled by communal dynamics.

Take as an example the famous artist Pablo Picasso. His unique poetic style is not only based on the work of predecessors and contemporaries, but has also been nourished by a series of events, innovations, and historical and scientific circumstances that transcend the strictly artistic boundaries. If, by some chance, Picasso had been born in the year 1000, it would be easy to imagine that he would still have become an artist, but certainly not have developed cubism.

Observing a painting such as Guernica (1937), we will not only see the fruit of the painter's talent, but also a complex causal interweaving of a historical event, the changes in visual culture introduced by photography and cinema, the painting experimentation of the time, the "new science," the wounds caused by wars, the discovery of African art... this work is not the fruit of a mind detached from its time, but the result of a huge cultural laboratory, in which – consciously or not – the technological and scientific revolutions, the military traumas, the political struggles, and the attempts to renew visual language participated (Richardson 1996).

However, the forces at play around the genesis of a work are not exclusively human. Sometimes, material, geographical, and environmental conditions play a determining role, having little to do with human will. The availability or price of certain pigments—such as lapis lazuli powder or some colors derived from volcanic minerals—has significantly influenced the chromatic range of past painters, as have the symbolic meanings of color (Ingold 2013). Even natural phenomena such as a volcanic eruption or a particular climate can become co-creators of a painting; for example, William Turner's palette was probably inspired by the unusual sunsets caused by volcanic dust dispersed in the atmosphere following the eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia in 1815 (Bennett 2010). From this perspective, the creative agency is not exclusive to artists but also involves the non-human world: chemical substances, geological conditions, technological instruments, historical and biographical events (Bennett 2010; Ingold 2013) also cause a work.

If copyright still relies on the narrative of individual genius to claim almost 'natural' protection, the historical and cultural reality instead shows how art, science, and technology are a continuous flow of exchanges. A flow that, constrained by overly rigid norms, risks suffocating the development of new languages and forms of knowledge (Lessig 2004). Authors like Kirby Ferguson (2010), with his project Everything is a Remix, have shown in an accessible way how the history of music, cinema, and modern art is a succession of remixes and constant reinterpretations: from blues blending into rock, to hip-hop sampling, down to the citationism of contemporary pop culture.

Chance also often plays a role in creation. In Venetian Blind, for example, the artist Michael Snow deliberately uses the random nature of the photographic medium, letting the Polaroid introduce blurs and overexposures that intervene as variables in the compositional process. As Perfetti points out, such a strategy is not a simple renunciation of control, but a way to activate a dynamic relationship between the author, the device, and the image (Perfetti 2025): the white spot in the foreground becomes a visual diaphragm, while the urban landscape in the background (the monumental Venice) remains in focus. This composition exemplifies how artistic creation often arises from the interplay between human intention, chance, and forces independent of the subject.

From a legal perspective, accepting the collective nature of intellectual works undermines the idea of an ontological copyright right, based on the artist's natural property right over the work. Furthermore, as Boldrin and Levine (Boldrin, Levine 2008) note, intellectual goods are characterized by factual non-exclusivity: sharing an idea does not take anything away from the original author, but rather enhances its scope. Differently from the appropriation of a material good, the reuse (or transformation) of an idea enhances its semantic richness. The boundaries between legitimate and illegal, in this context, prove to be cultural and historically variable, more than strictly defined by a natural law.

**The line between inspiration and plagiarism**

Although the collective nature of creation makes it almost inevitable to appropriate ideas, styles, and techniques, the problem remains open of determining when this dynamic constitutes a passing of the baton and when it instead leads to genuine plagiarism. The issue is by no means new: as early as the 18th century, there was intense debate over what constituted a legitimate source and what constituted theft of verses or musical themes, and the history of art is rich with examples in which the boundaries between inspiration and copying are by no means clear.

Today, ambiguity has become even more apparent for at least two reasons. On one hand, the technological component has made it easier to replicate, recombine, or manipulate existing materials. On the other hand, copyright law has expanded its area of control, defining - sometimes restrictively - what must be considered derivative and when a work is sufficiently transformative to fall within the category of legitimate uses (fair use, parody, etc.) (Litman 2006; Case 2020).

The most famous controversies of the last decades show how fragile this border is. Jeff Koons has been repeatedly accused of plagiarism for incorporating elements from others into his sculptures, from the case of String of Puppies (which re-used a photograph published on a birthday card) to the series of 'balloon dogs' (Blanch v. Koons 2006). Shepard Fairey, author of the iconic poster Hope for Barack Obama, was accused by the Associated Press agency, which claimed paternity of the original image (Kennedy 2011). In each of these cases, the distinction between plagiarism and inspiration is not an objective and measurable factor, but the result of rulings that, case by case, determine whether the artist's intervention is sufficiently original.

In musical terms, the issue is even more controversial. The case of Blurred Lines (2013) by Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, which was deemed too similar to Got to Give It Up (1977) by Marvin Gaye, has sparked a debate on the legitimacy of stylistic similarities and whether copyright should protect not only the melody but also the atmosphere and groove of a song (Wu 2015). If we allow legislation to extend into fuzzy areas such as style, however, we risk hindering the natural evolution of genres that often gain strength through adapting previous codes (Landes, Posner 2003). On the other hand, the fear of legal action can also generate a "preventive censorship" effect (chilling effect), in which artists end up self-censoring their work, giving up homage and rework that could lead to original works.

Abandoning the idea of an ontological right of authorship in favor of an economic criterion may seem innocuous, but it is not a gesture without consequences. It indeed means giving up the defense of authorship and originality in favor of an exclusively practical criterion: maximizing the economic compensation for those working in creative and knowledge-based fields without harming the spread of culture. This shift will allow us to approach some contemporary debates from a different perspective, as we will see in the case of generative artificial intelligence.
<br><br>

**Dataset for AI training. A copyright that benefits only the monopolies.**

The recent controversies over the use of protected datasets for training artificial intelligence systems are a clear example of how copyright law often favors the more powerful economic actors. Generative LLMs – from Midjourney to ChatGPT – are based on billions of images and/or texts, many of which are likely covered by copyright (datasets are often closed and it is impossible to control), from which they learn patterns to generate new, never exactly identical outputs, unless in rare cases (Carlini et alii 2021). In fact, the principle is not too different from the historical course of art, in which every author has always "stolen" ideas, styles, and suggestions from predecessors and contemporaries (Deleuze 1981, Rose 1993). Yet, what has been considered a legitimate act of inspiration for centuries is condemned when it is the AI that perform it.

However, from a purely economic perspective, the issue is more nuanced. The big tech companies, which have the financial power and infrastructure to manage massive datasets, avoid uncertain lawsuits by entering millions of dollar agreements with major right holders (for example, large publishers and media groups), thereby significantly rewarding only those who possess extensive data catalogs (Mallamaci 2024; GEDI 2024). For a single artist or writer with a hundred images or a few texts, contributing to a dataset composed of billions of contents does not yield a significant return; the incidence of their works is so marginal that the revenues from copyright, if any, would be negligible. The negotiations between OpenAI and publishing groups, as well as Meta and Adobe's strategies oriented towards "bulk purchasing" rights over large collections or using those already in their possession, demonstrate that copyright, far from protecting the work of minor authors, tends rather to consolidate agreements between powerful entities (Landes, Posner 2003; Larivière, Haustein, Mongeon 2015).

Furthermore, the tightening of protections on these datasets may exacerbate imbalances in the cultural diversity available to AI: if it became mandatory to pay for every small portion of protected work, machine learning models would risk drawing almost exclusively from large archives, neglecting independent and diverse contributions (Levendowski 2018). This scenario would increase the risk of bias and homogenization of content, limiting that expressive pluralism that also arises from niche works and marginal sources (Levendowski 2018).

To some, the ethical solution does not lie mainly in tightening prohibitions or demanding unrealistic micro-payments, but rather in ensuring greater transparency and openness of models and their code (D’Isa 2022). Making public what has been built upon a common heritage – such as the data uploaded to the network by users around the world – appears to be a strategy closer to the original matrix of the internet. An alternative proposal could be to bind the use of protected material to specific open source licenses, thus returning the fruit of training to the entire community, rather than concentrating power and profits in the hands of a few monopolists. In this sense, focusing exclusively on copyright to oppose the advancement of AI risks further legitimizing the privatization of a common good: data. As shown by cases of agreements between publishers and big tech, if the role of monopolies is not reexamined, reliance on traditional protections ends up enriching those who already possess a vast catalog and further marginalizing the multitude of independent authors.

A concrete example is DeepSeek, a Chinese LLM that – although developed in a politically restricted context – adopts an open-source license for its code, allowing developers and companies to customize the model relatively economically (D’Isa 2025). Rather than relying solely on computational power, the creators of DeepSeek have chosen to optimize energy consumption and cultivate computational sobriety: a path that, surprisingly, has allowed the model to approach the performance of much more "muscular" models like GPT-4, reducing costs and expanding the possibilities of application. It is nevertheless a significant economic and technological commitment, because the company behind this LLM had access to thousands of dedicated H100 GPUs for AI model computation; producing an LLM remains a significant commitment, but the comparison with other engines is still notable. Although not without censorship and bias - which can be circumvented as it is an open model - DeepSeek demonstrates how an open source (or at least open weight) approach can become a credible alternative commercially, encouraging scientific innovation and sustainability.

**Piracy as civil disobedience**

In the collective imagination, the term piracy evokes images of exotic hackers lurking in the dark web. However, various research and testimonies (Longo 2023; Lessig 2004) as well as the path outlined so far invite us to consider piracy also as a form of civil disobedience: an act of rebellion aimed at denouncing the inadequacy of an economically and normatively inadequate and restrictive control system.

In this regard, the phenomenon of online file-sharing communities is emblematic. Since the time of Napster (1999), passing through BitTorrent, Karagarga, eMule, and others, the sense of these circuits cannot be reduced simply to the violation of copyright for personal gain. Often users are passionate about cinema, music, rare or out-of-print books, and they commit to preserving and spreading works that would otherwise risk extinction (Longo 2023). In some cases, such as with *Nosferatu* or other author films, it has been precisely the underground circulation that has saved works of great historical and artistic value.

Another case of piracy as civil disobedience is that of Sci-Hub, the platform created by Alexandra Elbakyan to provide free access to academic articles behind paywalls (Bohannon 2016). Here, the 'theft' allows researchers and students—often outside institutions or without subscriptions—to consult fundamental studies for the advancement of research. Although within the university access to paid journals is relatively guaranteed (at the cost of substantial expenses supported by libraries and public funds), all those who do not belong to a research institution are excluded from this circuit, fueling a form of knowledge inequality. Moreover, even when a university regularly pays for access to editorial packages, the impact on academic budgets is significant and inevitably falls on the community.

Many scientific and university publishers indeed adopt particularly high prices, generating profits through a substantially oligopolistic market (Larivière, Haustein, Mongeon 2015). In the case of printed volumes and e-books intended for research, it is common to find exorbitant prices (often several hundred euros per single text), which put libraries and independent readers in difficulty. This is added to the high costs of open access publications; many publishers apply *article processing charges* (APC) that can exceed 2,000 or 3,000 euros per article (Solomon, Björk 2012). This means that, in addition to the cost of subscriptions and licenses, universities must pay to allow their researchers to publish open access, in a vicious circle that further exacerbates the cost of disseminating knowledge.

A piece of evidence supporting this hypothesis is the support this platform receives within the same scientific community. A survey published in "Science" (Bohannon 2016) revealed that a significant portion of researchers and students consider the use of pirate sites to access academic articles not only acceptable, but even necessary to carry out their work. The *Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto*, written by activist Aaron Swartz in 2008, is the text that transformed this perception into a political claim. For Swartz, knowledge cannot be private property, and anyone who has access to protected databases has a moral duty to share them with the world (Swartz 2008).

The cultural industry for years has told piracy as a plague that destroys the market, while others see it as a multiplier of visibility, a kind of lever that widens the audience rather than narrows it. Who is right? The available data do not give a clear answer. Some studies show that illegal sharing has eroded CD and DVD sales, especially since the early 2000s, but the apocalyptic scenario predicted has never materialized. On the contrary: in the music industry, for example, the loss in physical formats has often been accompanied by an increase in interest in concerts, merchandise, and other revenue channels (Oberholzer-Gee, Strumpf 2007). Even cinema presents a less linear picture than the majors would have us believe: if file-sharing has reduced profits from home video, some studies show that piracy has contributed to the success of niche films, creating a ripple effect that has drawn more viewers into the theaters (Smith & Telang 2012).

From a broader perspective, global research has shown that countries with high rates of piracy often coincide with those where more culture is consumed (Karaganis 2011). Not exactly the effect of a lethal threat. This suggests that piracy, far from being just a problem, is part of a more complex cultural ecosystem, in which legal consumption and alternative consumption coexist and feed each other. But here is the point: the data are fragmented, the economic and social variables are difficult to isolate. Those who condemn speak of incalculable damages, while those who defend it compare it to public libraries, which expand access without destroying the market. Probably the truth lies in the middle: more than a problem or a solution, piracy is a symptom. If a crime becomes structural and extremely widespread, it should automatically raise suspicion that it indicates a broader social problem. Thus, the point is not so much whether piracy is right or wrong, but rather whether it is rather a signal of a gap between the technological and cultural evolution and inadequate legislation. In this sense, digital piracy appears as the claim of the original promise of copyright: to promote the spread of culture and not to seal it behind ever higher barriers.
<br><br>

**Conclusion**

The history of copyright, from its origin with the first royal licenses to its most recent extensions, reveals the dual tension between the public interest in disseminating culture and knowledge and the desire to protect the economic exploitation of works. As we have seen, legislators have repeatedly responded to the claims of publishers and large cultural industries by extending the duration of protection and broadening the scope of control over the reuse of content. Although this process was originally conceived to promote creative production, it has ultimately hardened access and the circulation of ideas, generating situations that benefit intermediaries more than authors.

In parallel, precisely where copyright becomes more extensive and punitive, civil disobedience spaces multiply. Whether in film file-sharing circuits or in platforms offering free access to academic texts, so-called piracy is a signal of cultural resistance against a system perceived as unjust or outdated by technological evolution. Cases of *Nosferatu*, Sci-Hub, Napster, and other examples of clandestine circulation tell a recurring dynamic: when barriers are too high, communities react by circumventing them and producing (or preserving) culture, often more effectively than traditional legal distribution networks.

All this confirms that creativity itself is a collective fact, born from continuous exchanges, reinterpretations, and mutual influences. A protection regime that is too rigid can suffocate the creative potential of art and science, confining works that should instead circulate and transform, and may prove conceptually and practically inadequate in regulating new technologies such as artificial intelligence. Recognizing the essentially economic nature of copyright means abandoning the rigidity with which these norms are defended, in order to consider the possibility of reforms that balance the need to remunerate creators and the need for the sharing of knowledge. In this perspective, piracy is both a symptom and a catalyst for change, raising ethical, political, and cultural questions about the use and ownership of ideas and works of intellectual property.

Among the possible alternatives, which we will only briefly mention, a theme that has regained current relevance revolves around open licenses, such as Creative Commons, designed to give authors more flexible control over their creations: deciding which rights to retain and which to share. It is a revolution against the cage of a 'one-size-fits-all' copyright, allowing writers, musicians, researchers, and artists to immediately circulate their works while not giving up a deserved recognition (Lessig 2004).

In the field of scientific research, open access – with articles immediately available at no cost – is the answer to a dual problem: on one hand, breaking down paywalls that confine knowledge behind a price tag; on the other, challenging the oligopoly of major publishers, whose subscriptions burden the budgets of universities, forcing them to pay for works created by their own faculty and students (Suber 2012).

This is accompanied by the repeated proposal to drastically reduce the duration of protection: perhaps limiting it to twenty or thirty years after publication, or the death of the author, so as to prevent essential works for our cultural heritage from being buried in an almost eternal limbo of property. Some even call for a cultural tax, a sort of collective reimbursement to be distributed to creators and interpreters, decoupling access to content from fragmented payments for rights. These proposals, sometimes referred to as cultural flat rate (Grassmuck 2009; Fisher 2004; Aigrain 2012), aim at a flat-rate contribution model - for example, linking it to internet connection or storage devices - whose revenue would then be redistributed to authors based on usage metrics (downloads, streaming, etc.). In this way, access would be free, while the remuneration for creators would no longer be tied to the individual act of consumption.

Therefore, it is not proposed to eliminate copyright without offering an alternative; rather, it is about recognizing its exclusively economic nature in order to make it a more fluid mechanism, capable of adapting to the shared and cumulative fabric on which every creative act is based, rather than suffocating the constant exchange of ideas that nourishes cultural life.
