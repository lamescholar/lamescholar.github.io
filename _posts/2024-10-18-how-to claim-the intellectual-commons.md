# How to claim the intellectual commons

Workers have the leverage of union to compel the employer to satisfy their demands. Under the modern economic system, there is a limit to these demands. If the workers demand beyond the limit, the company will come to ruin. Unions can protect workers against abuses of power and overexploitation, they help workers to get what is due under existing conditions. But they cannot bring about radically new working conditions.

I think media piracy for the public is like a strike for the workers. It threatens the safe operation of patent monopolies, corporate secrets, black box designs - the safe reign of intellectual property. Usually, copyright infringement is settled among two economic agents competing with each other. But there can be another kind of copyright infringement. If the public undertakes the noncommercial violation of intellectual property, it can disrupt the established mode of business and compel studios and authors guilds to the demands of the public.

The difference from the workers is that the public is much bigger than a group of coworkers. The coworkers have an easier time coordinating their discontent about issues that affect their lives in the most direct ways. People can suffer great damage from the unmatched reign of intellectual property, yet they have a hard time accumulating their experiences, collectively formulating how exactly they are fucked by big studios and agreeing on a common set of actions. There are a lot of people with big audiences that talk about the enormous amount of power Amazon exercises over the landscape of ecommerce. They recommend something like using Bookshop.org, but nobody suggests to employ the boycott of Amazon, to commence in piracy of bestsellers.

Because piracy is ostracized as a threat to the well-being of authors. It is not conceived as a leverage to get what is due under modern technologies. There is a limit that can be set upon copyright without impoverishing the publishing industry. First of all, it's a shortening of copyright duration. From 70 to at least 10 years. So most recent cultural achievements can get out of the dark of corporate databases and see the light. Secondly, big digitization project should make collections of biggest libraries easily available to anyone with internet connection.

Today piracy tries to exist in the shadow. I think it's time for piracy to present its demands and get what is due. Without the leverage of piracy concerns about the enourmous power of technofeudalists will remain a mere talk. If there will be enough of enthusiasts scanning and sharing books via Library Genesis or [1337x](https://1337x.to/user/workerbee/) people with power will need to acknowledge the demands.
