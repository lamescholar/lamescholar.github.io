# Engels on authority
<br>

I long had some thoughts about the article On Authority written by Engels. This article is the reference in Marxist circles whenever you raise the issue of authority and government. It is easy to see why. Engels solves the question of authority by appealing to demands of the economy. It is perfect Marxist syllogism: the basis determines the superstructure.

The heart of Engels' argument is that we cannot avoid authority in modern economy where we must coordinate the work of large industries. Any given employee must be compelled to work within the established production chain.

Notice that what Engels describes here is economic authority. It is quite different from political authority. The difference between the two is easy to illustrate with Kant's article What is Enlightenment? In the article, Kant advocates for the liberty to express your opinion about the state of affairs, but while the rules are in place, one must follow his duties. Kant gives us a clear contraposition of political and economic authority. Political authority is ability to sketch a plan. Economic authority is a coersion to follow the plan.

Until the very end, Engels evades the issue of political authority. Who draws up the plan? Who's taken into consideration? What is the mechanism of conflict resolution?

Engels writes:

> All Socialists are agreed that the political state, and with it political authority, will disappear as a result of the coming social revolution, that is, that public functions will lose their political character and will be transformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over the true interests of society.

True interests of society. What are they? This vague term hides the fact that any society has conflicts of interest. If the interest of peasants in Russian agrarian society stands in the way of true interest of indurstrialization, peasants are crushed even though they constitute the majority of society.

That's the problem with the vanguard of the proletariat. First of all, proletariat is one class among many interest groups in the transition period. Second, how does bureucracy assume the interests of the proletariat? How the policy can be amended by the people? If there is an unaccountable body called the Politburo that has the supreme political authority to sketch the policies, then conflict resolution is skewed. After the fall of the Soviet Union, we know that dictatorial political authority costs a lot. Unaccountability inevitably leads to disasters.

Economic authority doesn't evaporate if we have no dictatorial political authority. Socialists can and must have effective mechanisms of conflict resolution. When we sketch policies, we must take into the account the interests of all sides, not brand people's material interests here and there as petty bourgeouis reactionary ideology. As though it's just a quirk of the mind and not the livelihood of millions. If we transition from private property, there should be avenues for people to enter the common ownership with dignity.

Engels closes the issue by saying that we can't abolish the political authority in one day. There are reactionaries that must be crushed. The revolution is authoritarian because it dictates its will to all classes of society. All right, but how do we get from most authoritarian to apolitical government that serves true interests of society?

That's essential question. It can't be postponed in a manner "we can't write recipes for the cookshops of the future".

Private property is a tool of conflict resolution. I hold my own estate, I command it, I am responsible for it, I can go to court to protect it. Thomas Jefferson wished that America would be the republic of farmers. Each and everyone would hold an estate. There would be no imbalance of power. But we do not live in such republic. We live in terribly unequal global capitalist system. It is skewed towards the people who own the means of production. And yet, we can't replace one mechanism with a half-cooked one unless we want to see what happened with collectivization and industrialization in the Soviet Union. All the friction of the policy when it collided with reality on the ground was blamed on sabotage. This conspiratorial thinking arises because there is not even a conception that policy of the vanguard can be against the interests of the people. This way, in 1933, the wheat was still collected and sold to the Western countries while the peasants were starving.
