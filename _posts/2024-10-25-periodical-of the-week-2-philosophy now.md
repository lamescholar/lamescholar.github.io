# Periodical of the Week #2 - Philosophy Now

Author: lamescholar - 2024-10-25

**Philosophy Now** is British monthly philosophy magazine. It features popular articles on philosophy with inclination towards philosophy of mind. At the end of each issue there are always an intresting column by Raymond Tallis.

If you're located in the US and you want to get a printed issue, they can be found in Barnes & Noble magazine rack.

Got this issue at local Barnes & Noble:

Tallis column of this issue is about physicalist confusion about human mind. [The article](https://philosophynow.org/issues/161/The_Illusion_of_Illusionism) in general is very good, though, I think, Tallis slips in one passage:

"how and why such brain activity might deceive itself as to its own nature"

I think Tallis shouldn't slide into brain-activity-language. Blockhead darwinists may say that this deceite is conditioned by evolution. Even if the answer is provided, the language itself is still wrong. You cannot say that brain activity deceives itself, because this biological process lacks experience to have an illusive experience.
