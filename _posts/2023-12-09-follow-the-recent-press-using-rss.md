# How to follow the recent press using RSS?

3 elements:

1) VPN in case there is a strong censorship in your country

2) Bypass Paywalls Clean to bypass paywall

3) List of RSS feeds + RSS reader to collect news from news sites
<br><br>

**1) VPN. Virtual server + WireGuard.**
<br><br>

**2) Bypass Paywalls Clean is an extension that opens articles accessible only to subscribers of newspapers and magazines.**

For Chrome you need to download an archive.

Unzip. In Chrome open the extensions settings. Turn on Developer mode. Load unpacked extension - folder.

Done.

With Bypass Paywalls Clean it's good to have adblock. uBlock Origin.

<br><br>

**3) To use RSS you need to have a collection of RSS feeds themselves and RSS reader.**

The best (in my opinion) RSS reader is yarr (yet another rss reader).

Here's the page on GitHub.

But since the last release there was a significant change. So it's better to use recently compiled exe. Here's the one compiled by me:

My collection of RSS feeds:

<a href="/files/subscriptions.opml" download>subscriptions.opml</a>

Guide on RSS in general:

As a result we got free access to recent updates from 400 sources.
