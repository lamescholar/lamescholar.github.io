#### Locked database

Judging from ChatGPT's performance, OpenAI got rich database of texts. This database distributed in very indirect way, and still there are people who hate even this mediated distribution of the database.

#### A bad aspect of ChatGPT

It just gives an extract from its database, leaving you completely alienated from sources, methods, practice of producing the result. At the same time it has great potential of research assistant if sources, methods, practice will be exercised by majority of people.

Science is not some text, compiled from other texts. It's understanding, evolution of thought, it's constant self-improvement of thought that sourced from interaction and transformation of reality through production, discussion, developing tools, implementing knowledge in work, art, everyday life.

This dread of ChatGPT replacing average authors gives me Baudrillardian vibe. French philosopher Baurdillard wrote an article called [Requiem for the Media](https://disk.yandex.ru/i/FuDeFoGEZX3jWQ). The idea of this article is that the very form of communication one-many exclude the possibility of dialog, of ambivalent communication. Mechanisms of feedback are just extra variables of broadcast. Key moment is that the prevailing form of communication is broadcast, all gazes pointed at one source. Everybody try to climb the mount of popularity, try to integrate into the mechanism of distribution of information when you talk to your audience in such a way that you never get an answer from it. You spread fixed message that nobody can negotiate with. You can't talk with copypasta.

So, why I get this vibe? Because with ChatGPT in this scheme of communication you don't even need the author to produce a message. So, this scheme completely exclude people talking to each other. The only entity that remains is generated message distributed through media.

#### Knowledge is a process

If you don't read and think, you just float in this this pile of discourses without touching the reality. It's just dead thought bleached from any connection with reality. You lose sense of who you are, what your views are, how they originate, develop, self-prove, self-explain. You got the final result, the conclusion without all the important part - your worldview, style of thought, set of arguments, your own elaboration of them.

Today we have the prevalence of image over the process. In this regard I really liked the book by Nagel [What Does It All Mean?](http://library.lol/main/83B828F7D834D32535A1222762C4F01C) He set the questions that I recall thinking about on my own.

I like how instead of stereotypical solutions, which ChatGPT would give, he crushes you with these questions urging you to cope with them by yourself, urging you start to think.

Knowledge is a process.

#### Potential

I'm very enthusiastic about ChatGPT's potential. Apart from research assistance you can read any language - its translation is pretty stable. You can actually read the book on language you don't know with help of bilingual dictionary.

We got Internet, we got [digitization technologies](/en/book-digitization), we got [OCR](/en/ocr), we got [decent translation tool](/en/chatgpt) - all the technological necessities to explore. But they are strangled by copyright bullshit, patents, corporate secrets, paywalls that stand in the way of distribution of sources and tools to learn.

Of course, copyright exists for a purpose. That's the way the production of information stay profitable, paying authors along the way. We can't just banish the copyright. Copyright must be replaced with alternative that pays for production and not at the expense of distribution.

Like public funding, crowdfounding, selffounding (if expenses to buy sources and tools for research are absent, then you just need to eat something, live somewhere while you work).

#### Artificial intelligence

ChatGPT is a tool to extract review from database or perform translation. That's it. So, if somebody fantasizes another - it's really silly misconception. For them Chomsky wrote an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html) in NY Times.
