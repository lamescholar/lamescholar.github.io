# What Matters
<br>

There is an order

To the universe

It ain't all random

There's discipline in gravity

Pulling against centrifugal force

Enforcing orbits on otherwise wandering planets

We aren't forced toward destruction and extinction

We force ourselves

What we do for each other

Will always matter.
