# How to follow the press using RSS?

**3 things are needed:**

1) VPN in case there is a strong censorship in your country

2) Bypass Paywalls Clean extension to bypass paywall

3) Collection of RSS feeds + RSS reader to collect news from news sites
<br><br>

**1) [VPN](/en/vpn)**
<br><br>

**2) Bypass Paywalls Clean extension opens articles accessible only to subscribers of newspapers and magazines.**

Download the archive. Unzip. In Chrome open the extensions settings. Turn on Developer mode. Load unpacked extension - folder.

Done.

In addition it's good to have an adblock.

uBlock Origin - <https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm>
<br><br>

**3) A collection of RSS feeds themselves and RSS reader.**

The best (in my opinion) RSS reader is yarr (yet another rss reader).

Here's the page on GitHub:

<https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr>

Since the last release there was a significant change. So it's better to use recently compiled exe. Here's the one compiled by me:

My collection of RSS feeds:

<a href="/files/subscriptions.opml" download>subscriptions.opml</a>

In the end we get free (not counting VPN) access to recent publications from hundreds of sources.
